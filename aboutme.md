# About Me  

Hi! I’m **Haridhanush Ravichandran**, a graduate student pursuing my **Master’s in Data Science at the University of Padova (2024–26)**.

💻 I completed my **Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Science** in India (2019–2023).

🔬 I'm passionate about:
- 🧠 **Machine Learning**
- 🤖 **Deep Learning**
- 🗣️ **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**
- 🔗 **Knowledge Representation & Reasoning (KRL)**

📈 I'm actively building projects to deepen my expertise in applied AI and real-world problem solving.

## 💻 Experience & Projects  

I’ve worked on projects spanning computer vision, natural language processing, and data-driven systems:  

- 🖼️ **CNN Image Classifier** — Kaggle challenge model with 90% accuracy.  
- 📝 **Sentiment Analysis** — NLP model using transformers for text classification.  
- 🌐 **Knowledge Graph Exploration** — Built semantic reasoning models with graph-based learning.  

I also enjoy participating in **Kaggle competitions** and **open-source contributions** to challenge myself and collaborate with the global AI community.
