# About Me  

Hi! I’m **Haridhanush Ravichandran**, a graduate student pursuing my **Master’s in Data Science at the University of Padova (2024–26)**.

💻 I completed my **Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Science** in India (2019–2023).

🔬 I'm passionate about:
- 🧠 **Machine Learning**
- 🤖 **Deep Learning**
- 🗣️ **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**
- 🔗 **Knowledge Representation & Reasoning (KRL)**

📈 I'm actively building projects to deepen my expertise in applied AI and real-world problem solving.

## 💻 Experience & Projects  

My work explores computer vision, neuro-symbolic learning, and time-series forecasting:

- **🧠 Neuro-Symbolic Learning for MNIST Digit Relationships**  
  Developed a neuro-symbolic model on MNIST that combines deep learning with logical reasoning to learn and infer digit relationships.  

- **🌦️ Weather Forecasting (Deep Learning Challenge)**  
  Built a transformer-based deep learning model for time-series weather forecasting using historical weather data.  

- **🖼️ Image Classification (Kaggle Challenge)**  
  Developed and trained a convolutional neural network to classify images into 20 distinct categories for a university deep learning challenge.

I also enjoy participating in **Kaggle competitions** and **open-source contributions** to challenge myself and collaborate with the global AI community.
