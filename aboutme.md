Hi! I'm **Haridhanush Ravichandran**, currently pursuing an MS in Data Science at the University of Padova (2024–2026).  
I'm passionate about Deep Learning, NLP, Knowledge Representation and Reasoning, and Symbolic Learning.

Tools I’ve worked with include PyTorch, Tableau, and Power BI.

This portfolio showcases my academic and personal projects, with more coming soon!
