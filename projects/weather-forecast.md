# 🌦️ Weather Forecasting (Deep Learning Challenge)  

## 📌 Overview  
Built a **transformer-based deep learning model** for time-series weather forecasting using historical weather data.  

## 🔧 Tech Stack  
- Python  
- PyTorch  
- Transformers for Time Series (Attention-based models)  
- Pandas, Matplotlib  

## 📊 Key Highlights  
- Used historical temperature, humidity, and wind speed data for prediction.  
- Applied transformer architectures to capture long-range temporal dependencies.  
- Achieved accurate multi-step weather predictions compared to baseline models.
