# 🧠 Neuro-Symbolic Learning for MNIST Digit Relationships  

## 📌 Overview  
Developed a neuro-symbolic model on the MNIST dataset that combines **deep learning** with **logical reasoning** to learn and infer digit relationships.  

## 🔧 Tech Stack  
- Python  
- PyTorch  
- Neuro-Symbolic AI frameworks  
- NumPy, Matplotlib  

## 📊 Key Highlights  
- Integrated symbolic rules with neural networks for reasoning tasks.  
- Demonstrated the ability to infer relationships beyond raw digit classification.  
- Showed how neuro-symbolic learning can improve explainability in AI.
